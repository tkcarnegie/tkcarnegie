ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @tkcarnegie (a.k.a., Tait Kaminski). I'm a technical specialist at Carnegie Institution for Science in Pasadena, where I work with the Department of Biosphere Sciences and Engineering at Caltech, as well as at the Carnegie Observatories. All of the code here is strictly for Carnegie, you can find some of my other personal projects @taitk6057. 

ðŸŽ¯ I'm interested in high-performance computing (HPC), teaching introductory programming, data analysis, and applied computer science.
